- Build static HTML slideshow files from Markdown files.
    - Turn a single Markdown file into a HTML slideshow.
    - Turn a directory with Markdown files into a collection of HTML slideshows.
- Publish your slideshow(s) anywhere that static files can be served.
    - Locally, on a webserver, deploy through CI/CD with GitHub/GitLab (like this repo!), ...

---

- Preview your site as you work, thanks to [python-livereload](https://pypi.org/project/livereload/).
- Use custom favicons, CSS themes, templates, ... if desired.
- Support for emojis :smile: :tada: :rocket: :sparkles: thanks to [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/)
- Depends heavily on integration/unit tests to prevent regressions.
- And more!
