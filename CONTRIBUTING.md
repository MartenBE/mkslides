# Contributing guidelines

Thank you very much for contributing! Every help is welcome :).

## Workflow

If you have a bugfix, feel free to create a PR. If you have a feature request you can open an issue (or a PR if you already have code).

## Code guidelines

Here are some guidelines we ask to follow:

- The used language is English.
- Files should be UTF-8.
- Everything should come with as much [tests](./tests) as possible.
- The readability of code is very important.
- Formatting and linting is checked in the PR, please adhere to these checks. You can check the [CI/CD pipeline](./.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml) for the exact checks.
